# CNN-Implementation-for-Binary-Image-Classification-Cats-vs-Dogs

This Notebook presents a full pipeline for binary image classification using a convolutional neural network (CNN), applied to the "Cats vs Dogs" dataset from Kaggle.
Notebook Highlights:

•	Extracted and organized real-world image data from compressed archives

•	Programmatically sorted images into class-specific directories based on filename patterns

•	Created a structured directory hierarchy for training, validation, and testing datasets

•	Preprocessed and loaded image data using TensorFlow’s image_dataset_from_directory utility

•	Built and trained a CNN model using Keras, including convolutional, pooling, and dense layers

•	Tracked accuracy and validation loss across multiple epochs during training

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of data handling, dataset structuring, and CNN-based model implementation for visual classification tasks.

This notebook (including the code) was provided as part of a course exercise and used to practice and apply theoretical concepts in a practical way.
